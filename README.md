This is a website for people who love to jump (and to see others jumping). Enjoy pictures of other people jumping, and even upload your own!

Getting Started
===============

Have you ever wanted to fly? Of course you have. Did you know that you already can, for hundreds if not thousands of milliseconds at a time?! All you need to do is crouch down, say goodbye to the ground, and then push yourself into the atmosphere! As you launch upwards, take the time to feel air rushing through your hair, that incredible feeling of weightlessness, and the adrenaline rush as the ground comes back up to meet you... Exhilarating isn't it?

As you slowly become reaccustomed to life on the ground, don't worry if you feel a strong urge to jump again...in fact embrace it! Keep jumping, and if you really love it, take pictures, come to this site, and upload them to inspire others to throw their bodies into the air. And if you want a little inspiration to help you take your own jumping further, look no further my friend, this site is for you.

Happy jumping!
